iOS-Dev-Helpers

==================================================
INTRODUCTION

-Hello world, I am an iOS developer.

-But I love programming and love to make each day of my programmer-life enjoy even with iOS or any platform (maybe winphone in future ^^)

-This project aim to provide helper classes, functions, categories for easier and more efficient development for iOS.

-Please feel free to use, copy, edit, and share for personal, commercial purposes without any restriction.


==================================================
WHAT INSIDE ?

1. NSObject+Wrapper

-Help you fill all properties of NSObject-based class instance by dictionary.

-Have you ever want to provide detail info of UIButton, UITextField, ... or any control, you want to have a track. The original solution is use "subclassing".
    But with category support and objc-runtime, we can make a greater solution than you expected, you can access detail information by "setDetail:forKey:" and retrieve by "getDetailOfKey:", like what you alway work with a dictionary.
